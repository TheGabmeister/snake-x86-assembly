# Snake Game in x86 Assembly
Forked from https://github.com/meixinchoy/Snake-Game-Assembly-Language

To test this project on Windows, run the commands:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheGabmeister/pong-x86-assembly.git
cd pong-x86-assembly
extract-Irvine32.bat
```
The batch file will extract the Irvine library from the submodule, and will delete the submodule. Open `snake.sln` using Visual Studio 2022. It should have all the necessary includes already set up and will link to Irvine32.lib automatically when you run it.

# Controls
